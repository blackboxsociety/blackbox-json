Black Box Json
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blackboxsociety/blackbox-json.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blackboxsociety/blackbox-json)

This is a very simple JSON parser with minimal dependencies. The parser itself is
only about 60 lines of code and the code to print json is much less.
